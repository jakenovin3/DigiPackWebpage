# DigitalBackpack
##### Our role in expanding the Digital Backpack consists of better connecting everyone with their school-related work by building new features into the system and developing a fresh and accessible user interface. 

### Problem Statement
From recent history in the field of education, the world has seen a continual shift towards the integration of technology into the process of education, from K-12 and beyond. This shift has been incredibly prominent during 2020, when countless schools throughout the world closed their doors and went to being 100% online resulting from COVID-19. This transition, however, has also left many people with incredibly limited access to their education due to the newfound coupling of the internet and schooling.
